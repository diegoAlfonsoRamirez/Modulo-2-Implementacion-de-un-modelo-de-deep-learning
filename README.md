## About
This project is designed to predict whether a customer will dispute a complaint provided in text form. It utilizes a deep learning model, Word2Vec embeddings, and a Tkinter interface to make predictions.

## Features
- Text input for predicting complaint disputes.
- Pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings.
- Deep learning model for prediction.
- Tkinter interface for input and predictions.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

> Prerequisites
> 
> Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
> - Python (version 3.x)
> > Required Python packages (install using pip):
> > - numpy
> > - pandas
> > - scikit-learn
> > - tensorflow
> > - gensim
> > - tkinter (for the user interface)

## Usage
- To train and test the model, run "Implementaci√≥n de un modelo de deep learning.ipynb".

- To use the model for predictions, run "Interfaz.py".

- Use the provided Tkinter interface for entering text and obtaining predictions.
